# Iris-Dataset-Python-Notebook-Solution

The notebook performs exploratory data analysis on the titanic data set. The data set was downloaded from kaggle website.

Multiple packages were used in the notenook. These packages were imported into python 3.6. The packages used are:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
sklearn

The first two packages are for combutation and data analysis, the next package is for data visulaization and the last is for machine learning models.

Predicting the likelihood of survival using scikit learn package will be discussed in future posts.
